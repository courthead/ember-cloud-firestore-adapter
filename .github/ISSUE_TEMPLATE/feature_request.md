*Before anything else, the goal of this addon is just to provide a means to have Firestore integrate with Ember Data while exposing as much of the JS SDK as possible. Thus, we generally avoid adding sugar/convenience APIs. If Firestore JS SDK doesn't support what you want to do, then we won't either. This is one of the reasons why `store.queryRecord` isn't supported because at the moment of writing this, Firestore doesn't support querying and returning an object, it still returns an array even if it contains just a single document.*
